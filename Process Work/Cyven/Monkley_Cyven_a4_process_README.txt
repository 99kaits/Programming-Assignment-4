NOTES is the messy math and logic I was doing to determine how to move the ball with arrow keys while maintaining momentum, and then changing to using the mouse to drag it instead (and visualising the cosine math for that so I didnt get confused)

CODE is a txt copy of the original 2d topdown movement with arrow keys that I was struggling with and decided to "scrap" (may come back to fix with what ive learned at a later date.) Saved as a txt to avoid the possibility of messing things up when compiling the rest of the program
